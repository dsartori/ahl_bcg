<p class="p1"><br>Chomp is a simple two-player strategy game which takes place on a rectangular grid of squares.  
			  This grid represents a chocolate bar which has one "poisoned" piece in the upper-left hand corner.   Players alternately 
			  touch squares on the chocolate bar to take bites.  When you take a bite, all of the squares below and to the right of your
			  chosen piece are "chomped."  The player who is forced to eat the poisoned piece loses, ending the game.</p><br>
<p class="p1">The version of Chomp you are playing can be played against a friend, solo against the computer, or you can watch the 
			  computer play both sides of the game.  By selecting different board dimensions you can explore the different properties 
			  and winning conditions of the game.</p><br>
<p class="p1">Chocolate Chomp is an implementation of the game Chomp, described by mathematician David Gale in 1974.  
			  Gale described the winning strategies for two small Chomp boards, as discussed below.</p>

<p class="h2" id="#Math"><br>The Math<br></p>
<p class="p1"><br>Chomp is an example of a <i>combinatorial game</i>.  Chess, checkers and tic-tac-toe are all combinatorial games.</p>
<p class="p1">All combinatorial games have these characteristics in common:</p>
<ul >
	<li class="l1"><i>Two player.</i></li>
	<li class="l1"><i>Perfect information.</i>There is no information hidden from either player.</li>
	<li class="l1"><i>No chance moves.</i>There are no dice,spinners or other randomizing elements.</li>
	<li class="l1"><i>Positions.</i>The game is made up of a series of positions, which can be considered games themselves.</li>
	<li class="l1"><i>Options.</i>At each position, the two players have zero or more moves, or options, available to them.</li>
	<li class="l1"><i>Finite.</i>The game must eventually end (one or both players have no <i>options</i> remaining.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The two players in a game are usually called <i>Left</i> and <i>Right</i>, or <i>L</i> and <i>R</i>.  Typically, a combinatorial game
			  conforms to the <i>Normal Play Convention</i>, in which a player is declared the "loser" when that player has no valid options
			  available.  Chomp is unusual in this respect as it uses the <i>Mis&egrave;re Play Convention</i>.  Under this convention, the last
			  player to move loses.  It is easy to see that Chomp would be no game at all under normal play, since any intelligent
			  player would immediately "chomp" the entire board.</p><br>
<p class="h2" id="#Strategy"><br>Strategy<br></p>
<p class="p1"><br>It is proven that there is a winning strategy for Chomp: player 1 can always win with a perfect strategy.
			  Because Chomp is symmetric (both players have the same set of available moves), the first player can always
			  win by playing the winning strategy first. 
		      In this sense, Chomp is a <i>solved game</i>, however the winning strategy for most boards is not known.  </p></br>
